##Fourth, the development environment: easy to install and configure XOOPS frame
1. 
The need for XOOPS sites, of course, there will be a web server (such as: Apache), databases (such as: MySQL or MariaDB), PHP basic environment.
1. 
Students practice the application hosting space ( http://163.26.52.243 )
    *

Sitelinks Location: http: // computer IP or http: // localhost or http://127.0.0.1

##Sixth, download XOOPS250ModuleConversionFiles
1. 
OOPS250ModuleConversionFiles basic module architecture is provided by the official, but the download version has been optimized first, and added bootstrap support for each version, so would recommend using this version (20,150,321) to develop relatively easy to use.
1. 
A XOOPS module is a directory, this directory will be placed under the modules.
1. 
Is a modular directory structure under the new proposal (after 2.5) XOOPS's (PHP> 5.2):

##Seven, understanding xoops_version.php
1. 
Under XOOPS modules directory must have xoops_version.php profile, otherwise it is not a standard module.
1. 
Please follow the order profile, a relative file out.
1. 
$ Modversion ['version'] version number wording: 1.0,2.3 ... can be, but need to be written 1.0.1 1.01.
1. 
$ Modversion ['module_status'] module status can be Alpha, Beta, RC, Release
1. 
$ Modversion ['adminmenu'] background menu icon is 32x32, can be downloaded from here:
    * 
(1)  http://findicons.com
    *

1. 
xoops_version.php if used in Chinese part, the recommendations made language files.
1. 
If only for personal use, and that can directly write Chinese (string must be enclosed in quotation marks), but the preferences, be sure to use language.

xoops_version.php the language file will be located language / tchinese_utf8 / modinfo.php in (non-custom files or change the file name)
1. 
Language setting method: define ("_ MI_ language name", "corresponding to the actual Chinese");
1. 
"_MI_ Language name" is a PHP constant, _MI is the beginning of the constant XOOPS recommendations generally recommended to use at the beginning of the bottom line, and all uppercase, with easily recognizable (but actually not mandatory).
1. 
General _MI behind module name will be added to avoid constant conflict, such as: _MI_MYMOD_XXX
